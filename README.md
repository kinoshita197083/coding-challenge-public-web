# Zeller Web coding challenge

This is a starter project for a Blog app. The app is built using:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com)

## High Level Requirements

1. Create blog list page where the blog summaries are listed. Ex: Zeller blog page - https://www.myzeller.com/au/blog
2. Once you click on a blog summary it should be navigated to a blog view page - Ex: https://www.myzeller.com/au/blog/awaken

Styles do not need to match the examples above. Feel free to add styles as you see fit.

## Zeller checklist

1. Proper test coverage
2. Best practises for performance optimisation
3. Code quality
4. Quality and Responsive UI
5. Documentation describing the approach and setup guidelines.


## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Notes

- Replace `yourContentTypeId` in `pages/index.js` with your actual Contentful content type ID.
- Make sure the content type has fields like `title` and `description` as used in the UI.

Sample UI you should see by running the app
